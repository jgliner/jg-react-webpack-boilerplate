# react + es6 + webpack boilerplate
My standard setup for small React projects - NOT intended for production

## Requirements
* npm/NodeJS (v6.0.0+)

## Installation
1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm start``` (alternatively, ```npm run build``` to build bundle without starting the server)
3. Navigate to ```http://localhost:3005```
